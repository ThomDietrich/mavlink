## MAVLink MultiMAV Extension ##

We propose an extension of MAVLink for MultiMAV covering swarm management in groups and formations, maintenance by replacement and recharging, and furthermore regions and extensions on navigation capabilities.

Modifications are limited to `message_definitions\v1.0\multiMAV.xml`.

### License ###

MAVLink is licensed under the terms of the Lesser General Public License (version 3) of the Free Software Foundation (LGPLv3). The C-language version of MAVLink is a header-only library, and as such compiling an application with it is considered "using the library", not a derived work. MAVLink can therefore be used without limits in any closed-source application without publishing the source code of the closed-source application.
